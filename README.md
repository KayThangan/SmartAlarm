# Smart Alarm

Smart systems are automated systems that adapt to input data streams. Alarm clocks are an
everyday item that we use to schedule our lives. The scope for a smart alarm clock that knows
about our schedule for the day, knows what the weather will be and can tell the time has the
potential to be very useful.
